Challenge created to improve techniques as a frontend developer

---

## About test

This test is part of [Frontend Challenges](https://github.com/felipefialho/frontend-challenges) created by [Felipe Fialho](https://github.com/felipefialho).

## The Challenge

Repository: [Chaordic #2](https://github.com/chaordic/frontend-developer-challenge)

Create a landing page using HTML, CSS and JS

**Layout**: https://xd.adobe.com/spec/4025e242-a495-4594-71d2-5fd89d774b57-3614

**API Endpoint**: https://frontend-intern-challenge-api.iurykrieger.now.sh/products?page=1

### Behavior

To fill the page with product information, this [API](https://frontend-intern-challenge-api.iurykrieger.now.sh/products?page=1) must be consulted in a paginated way, and each page will return information on 8 products and a link to the next page.

Once the data is obtained, the following points should be implemented:

- For each product returned by the API, a product card with the respective information must be created in the product grid;
- By clicking on the button 'Ainda mais produtos aqui' the next API page must be consulted, generating 8 more products in the existing grid, below the produtcs already loaded by the first request;
- The forms must have their input fields validated according to the content (eg the email field must contain a valid email address).
